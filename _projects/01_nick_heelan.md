Nick is a Research Assistant in the Department of Physiology at Michigan State University where he also received his B.S. degrees in Biochemistry/Biotechnology and Genomics/Molecular Genetics. As an undergrad, Nick specialized in microscopy and DNA/RNA analysis. While completing research in electrochemical and neural engineering laboratories, he discovered that single-cell biology, biomedical engineering, and neuroscience were all topics of great interest. By integrating his education in neural biochemistry with bioengineering, Nick aims to explore cerebral circulation regulation and its connections to disease.
